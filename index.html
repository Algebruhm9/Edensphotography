            For about 6 years now I've been interested in capturing real life moments the way I've imagined it in my head. My passion
            for photography slowly grew as more time went on with me taking pictures. I started with taking photos of what I thought was interesting with
            my phone which at the time was a Galaxy S5. For a phone from 2014 it did take beautiful pictures. I used that for years, experimenting with
            many techniques and shooting methods. Then in January, 2018, I got my second phone the Galaxy Note 8 which further helped refresh my interests
            in photography. During a camping trip that year in May, I used that phone to take my very first images of astrophotography. A small glimpse into 
            the stars and the distant universe. I was blown away with the first couple of photos I took with that phone. I felt like some new aspect of photography
            opened up for me and it showed me a whole new world no matter how decent the first pictures came out.

            Then, in the summer of 2018, my parents bought a DSLR camera. I was beyond excited to test its capabilities and how it differs from my phone. I felt like
            a new world of photography opened up in front of my eyes. I was eager and curious to learn what it can do and the many techniques and methods of shooting
            I can test. For an entire year it was nothing but trial and error when taking photos. I learned about ISO, aperture, shutter speed, and how using different
            lenses helped in some scenarios. Many would think that taking good pictures with a good camera is all to make a masterpiece, but what many don't realize is 
            how thats only half the story and process. Editing is the other half I only had some vague experience with it. It was tough for a time because no matter how
            many tries I did with editing I always felt like I was doing something wrong or not doing something that should be done. It took me a couple of years to realize
            that editing isn't something thats done the same every time. There isn't a solid fixed formula to editing my photos right and that deep down it meant editing
            my photos to my liking and to my preference. That's where photographers like me can shine and show off our work in our own style and imagination. And this 
            photograph is made me excited to have learned a lot about photography.

            <h3 id="portheader"> Drone photography teaches me a lot</h3>
            By 2019 I've pretty much become familiar with my camera and had bought some accessories for it to better my methods of shooting and have help when taking pictures.
            But then I set my eyes on something else that I wanted: a drone. I've always been interested in drones since they really became popular during the second half of the
            decade. I watched a lot of videos of drones and the beautiful pictures they took and the perspective that was only able to be captured by a helicopter at the time.
            I was hooked and I wanted one. During this time my dad encouraged me to create a rental business. So during those first couple of months I saw how much money we were
            bringing in and I decided to buy the newest drone from DJI at the time: the Mavic 2 Pro. When it arrived I instantly fell in love with the videos and pictures it took
            what a powerful camera in such a little case. The only problem was that with the great pictures it took, there now needed to be a different style of editing in order 
            for the pictures to come out good. Even today I am still learning how to make every photo come out the best that it can be and I believe this is among the top 5 best
            pictures I've taken with my drone.
