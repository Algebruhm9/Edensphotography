Welcome to my personal website! For the past couple of months I've slowly been adding more and more to the website for people to come see and check out! 
So bear in mind if some parts of the website are broken or don't look right, I did just start learning web development recently ;)
So to whom may come upon my site, let me know how it looks. I'd like a second opinion on the site and what can be added and improved upon. I'm personally
proud of how far I've come in learning about web development and how its opened up my mind to a lot of concepts and challenges the people before me encountered. I 
honestly feel a lot more grateful about programmers and web developers and how they had it harder back then without the modern features that we have access to now.
