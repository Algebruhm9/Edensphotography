## Personal website showing off my photography portfolio as my hobby of being a photographer.

My portfolio website [link!](https://algebruhm9.github.io/Edensphotography/)

I'm glad to share with anyone who comes across this website my photography portfolio. Most of my work here is years in the making. From a young kid in elementary who took photos for fun to someone who does this as a real hobby, I am happy to show off the work I have here. There are a thousand or more photos that I have in my back catalog but will be showing off my **favorite** and most **memorable** work here.

I just learned **HTML & CSS** so of course this website will look bad at first. I plan to update it and give it a better UI the more I learn and expand my knowledge in web development. This is simply just a start and is improved upon everytime I learn something new and that can benefit the website. 


Taking a look at my profile will show other repositories and other websites I have created in the past but those were the very first I created during tutorials. This website is the latest one and is made with the current knowledge I have on **HTML & CSS**. JavaScript will probably be added on another new website to better implement and JS features in the beginning of making that website. This simply shows what can be done with vanilla **HTML & CSS** without any frameworks involved. (Not like I know how to use any frameworks yet haha)
